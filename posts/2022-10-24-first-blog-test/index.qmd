Hello! Welcome to my blog.

If you are reading this, that means you must have found my blog and website. I am currently learning data science through the Masters of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara.

I plan on using this blog space as a way to track and showcase what I am learning as I venture on data science journey. I also hope to make these blog posts fun, exciting and include the occasional pun.

Keep calm and code on,

Colleen
