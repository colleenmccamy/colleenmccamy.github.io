### the question

#### **Did the Time-of-Use electricity rate transition have an effect on energy demand in the greater San Diego region?**

### introduction

California has ambitious clean energy and decarbonization goals. [^1] To achieve these goals, California will need to increase its current electricity grid capacity by about three times. [^2] Time-of-use electricity rates are a value strategy to help reduce the investment needed for expanding grid capacity and can help maximize the use of renewable resources. [^3]

The Time-of-Use (TOU) energy rate referenced in this analysis establishes lower electricity prices for times when there is more renewable energy supply available and helps to encourage electricity use when generation is cleanest and lowest-cost. Additionally, energy rates are higher during the early evening peak to help promote less energy use during times when renewable energy supply decreases and grid operators need to ramp up generation from fossil-fuel based power plants. For the default residential rate, the higher cost hours or "peak hours" are from 4:00 - 9:00 p.m. [^4]

While many utilities have piloted time-varying rates, the recent California TOU transition was the biggest test of time-based rates yet - automatically switching over 20 million electricity consumers to a TOU rate. [^5] While there has been some initial research and analysis on time-based rates in electricity markets, there are limited results on mass-market transitions and how time-based rates affect total electricity consumption.

Answering the question, 'did the Time-of-Use electricity rate transition have an effect on peak energy demand in the San Diego region?,' can help provide insight on the policy's effect and spur further investigations on time-based rates throughout the state of California and beyond.

### the data

[Energy Demand Data]{.underline}\
Energy demand data used in this analysis are publicly available and provided by the US Energy Information Administration. The data were downloaded via the API dashboard [^6] and were selected to include the dates of July 1, 2018 to July 31, 2022, hourly demand by subregion in megawatt hours (MWh) in the local time zone (Pacific), and the San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGE) subregion. SDGE serves 3.7 million people through 1.5 million electric meters covering 4,100 square miles in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The energy demand data are an aggregate electricity demand from all customers throughout SDGE's service territory.[^7]

[Temperature Data]{.underline}\
In California, peak electricity demand and temperature is highly correlated. [^8] As this investigation looks into energy demand, temperature data was added to the analysis. The temperature data used in the following analysis are publicly available through the NOWData Online Weather Data portal from the National Weather Service, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [^9] The temperature data includes an average of daily maximum, minimum, and average temperature from numerous weather stations throughout San Diego County in degrees Fahrenheit. This analysis uses the maximum daily temperature at the same temporal scale as the energy demand data.

[^8]: Miller, Norman L., Katharine Hayhoe, Jiming Jin, and Maximilian Auffhammer. 2008. "Climate, Extreme Heat, and Electricity Demand in California." Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology 47 (6): 1834--44. https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JAMC1480.1. }

[^9]: US Department of Commerce, NOAA. n.d. "Climate." NOAA's National Weather Service. Accessed December 3, 2022. https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=sgx. }

Since the temperature data is an aggregate of multiple stations throughout San Diego County, this can cause bias as the SDGE service territory covers multiple different temperate regions which may not be accurately represented within the average of the stations. Also, the weather stations are more heavily concentrated towards the coast. This could cause bias in the temperature maximum temperatures.

### analysis

A multi-linear regression and time series decomposition analysis can help answer the question at hand. Prior to conducting the linear model, I also used summary statistics to a cutoff point for a dichotomous variable.

#### [Linear Model]{.underline}

To investigate if the implementation of the TOU policy had an effect on energy demand, I used a multiple linear regression model. However, since other factors also have an effect on electricity demand, I added the temperature and hour of the day on hourly electricity demand. The equation for this model is: $$hwy_i =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \cdot TOUPolicy_i +\beta_{2} \cdot \text HotDay_i+ \beta_{3} \cdot \text PeakHour_i +\varepsilon_i$$

The 'TOUPolicy' predictor ('tou_policy' in the results) is a dichotomous variable indicating if the TOU Policy was in effect or not. The 'PeakHour' predictor is also a dichotomous variable which indicates whether or not the hour of the day was during peak times from 4:00 - 9:00 p.m.

Lastly, the 'HotDay' variable ('hot_day' in the results) is a dichotomous variable indicating if the maximum temperature for the San Diego region was equal to or greater than 80 (°F) or below 80 (°F). This cutoff temperature was determined by looking at the mean and standard deviation of the maximum temperature in San Diego during the time of interest. Outlined below in the boxplot, the average maximum temperature was about 72 (°F) and the standard deviation about 7 (°F). thus, 80 (°F) was determined to be a 'hot day' in looking at the effect of temperature and hourly electricity demand.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}

### ---- Determining a "Hot Day" ---- 

# determining the mean and standard deviation for the time period of interest
mean_max_temp <- mean(energy_temp_df$temp_max, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_max_temp <- sd(energy_temp_df$temp_max, na.rm = TRUE)

print(mean_max_temp)
print(sd_max_temp)

# preparing the data to plot
box_data <- as_tibble(energy_temp_df$temp_max)

# plotting the mean and standard deviation
temp_box <- ggplot(box_data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = value)) +
  labs(x = "Maximum Daily Temperature (°F)") +
  theme_minimal()

temp_box

### ---- Adding a 'Hot Day' Indicator in the Dataframe ---- 
temp_demand_daily <- energy_temp_df |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(daily_energy_mwh = sum(hourly_energy_mwh)) |> 
  left_join(temp_data, by = "date") |> 
  mutate(hot_day = case_when(
    (temp_max >= 80) ~ 1,
    (temp_max <= 79) ~ 0))

### ----- Adding TOU Policy and Peak Hours to Dataframe -----

# adding a year separate year column in the dataframe
energy_temp_df <- energy_temp_df |> 
  mutate(year = date)

energy_temp_df$year <- format(energy_temp_df$year, format = "%Y") 

# using variables to create dichotomous predictors
energy_temp_df <- energy_temp_df |> 
  mutate(tou_policy = case_when(
    (year > 2020) ~ 1,
    (year <= 2020) ~ 0)) |> 
  mutate(time = as_datetime(time, format = "%H:%M:%S")) |> 
  mutate(time = lubridate::hour(time)) |> 
  mutate(tou_policy = case_when(
    (year > 2020) ~ 1,
    (year <= 2020) ~ 0)) |> 
  mutate(peak_hours = case_when(
    (time < 16) ~ 0,
    (time >= 16 & time <= 21 ) ~ 1,
    (time > 21) ~0)) |> 
  mutate(hot_day = case_when(
    (temp_max >= 80) ~ 1,
    (temp_max <= 79) ~ 0))

#### ----- Linear Regression on Hourly Energy Demand ---- ###
model_tou_peak_demand <- lm(formula = hourly_energy_mwh ~ 
                              tou_policy + 
                              peak_hours +
                              hot_day, 
                            data = energy_temp_df)

```

The previous regression model predicts energy demand given that each predictor doesn't influence the relationship between the energy demand and another variable. However, thinking about the time-of-use policy implementation, we can add an interaction model to the linear regression to see if the effect of peak hours is affected by the TOU policy implementation. I would predict that there would be a greater energy decrease after the TOU policy was implemented than before during the peak hours.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
model_int_tou_peak_demand <- lm(formula = hourly_energy_mwh ~ 
                              tou_policy + 
                              peak_hours +
                              hot_day + 
                              peak_hours * tou_policy,
                            data = energy_temp_df)

summary(model_int_tou_peak_demand)

```


#### [Time Series Analysis]{.underline}

To dive furthering into additional affects on energy demand, I conducted a classical decomposition analysis to look into other factors influence hourly electricity demand, such as seasonality or overall energy demand trends.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}


x = seq(from = ymd('2018-07-1'), 
        length.out = 1481,
        by='day')

# preparing the dataframe for the time series
decom_df <- energy_temp_df |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarize(daily_energy_mwh = sum(hourly_energy_mwh)) |> 
  mutate(index = x)

decom_ts <- as_tsibble(decom_df, index = index)

decom_plot_annual <- model(decom_ts, 
                    classical_decomposition(daily_energy_mwh ~ 
                                              season(365), 
                                            type = "additive")) |> 
  components() |> 
  autoplot(col = "#3d405b") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Classical Decomposition Model",
       subtitle = "Seasonality defined as 365 days",
       x = "Date",
       caption = "Figure 3")

decom_plot_monthly <- model(decom_ts, 
                    classical_decomposition(daily_energy_mwh ~ 
                                              season(30), 
                                            type = "additive")) |> 
  components() |> 
  autoplot(col = "#3d405b") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Classical Decomposition Model",
       subtitle = "Seasonality defined as 30 days",
       x = "Date",
       caption = "Figure 2")
```

### results

[Multiple Linear Regression:]{.underline}\
We can interpret all of the predictors used in the regression are significant predictors for hourly electricity demand at a significance level of 0.001 as they all had a p-value of 2 x e^-16^. The model indicates that when daily maximum temperature is below 80 °F, for non-peak hours and prior to the Time-of-Use implementation in 2020, the average hourly electricity demand is about 2,164 MWh for the SDGE's service territory. In addition, we expect to see on average a decrease in hourly electricity demand by about 108 MWh for years after the Time-of-Use energy policy was implemented, holding all other predictors constant. For days in which the maximum temperature above 80 °F, the model predicts that the average hourly electricity demand increases by about 409 MWh holding all other predictors constant.

Interestingly, the model predicts that the average hourly electricity demand decreases by about 360 MWh holding all other predictors constant. At first thought, we may expect too see hourly electricity demand to increase during peak times as these are times in which the time-of-use electricity highlights as times with high demands. However, in this analysis we didn't look at the amount of renewable electricity available on the grid. Thus, overall energy demand may be lower during peak times but it is possible the percent of average hourly electricity demand in relation to hourly renewable electricity available on the grid may be higher during peak times than non-peak times.

Table 1 highlights the estimates, p-value and confidence interval for each of the predictors and intercept and the following equation for the linear regression model is:

$$Hourly EnergyDemand = 2164 - {108} \cdot TOUPolicy_i - {360} \cdot \text HotDay_i+ {409} \cdot \text PeakHour_i +\varepsilon_i$$

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
tab_model(model_tou_peak_demand,
          pred.labels = c("Intercept", 
                          "TOU Policy In Effect", 
                          "During Peak Hours", 
                          "Max. Temp above 80 (°F)"),
          dv.labels = c("Hourly Electricity Demand (MWh)"),
          string.ci = "Conf. Int (95%)",
          string.p = "P-value",
          title = "Table 1. Linear Model Results for Predictors on Hourly Electricity Demand",
          digits = 2)

ggPredict(model_tou_peak_demand, 
          jitter = TRUE, 
          interactive = TRUE)
```

This figure above graphs the magnitude of the decrease for the TOU policy for each of the outcomes of the other predictors.

[Multiple Linear Regression with the interaction model:]{.underline}\
This interaction model tells us that the average change in hourly energy demand during peak hours after the TOU policy was implemented compared to hourly energy demand during peak hours before the TOU policy was implemented is -98 MWh and is statistically significant at a significance level of 0.001 (p-value of 2 x e^-16^). The graph (Figure 3) below of the linear model with the interaction model indicates that the relationship between energy demand and peak hours varies based on the implementation of the TOU policy. 


```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}

ggPredict(model_int_tou_peak_demand, 
          jitter = TRUE, 
          interactive = TRUE)
```

The adjusted R^2^ values also increased slightly (from 0.213 to 0.214) when adding the interaction model. This demonstrates that the interaction model slightly increases model fit. 

However, the adjusted R^2^ value indicates that only about 21% of hourly energy demand is explained by the model. With this information, we can hypothesis that there are other factors that affect hourly energy demand not included within this model. Therefore, we can state that the time-of-use policy implementation had a statically significant decrease in hourly energy demand (at a significance level of 0.001) but overall hourly energy demand is more greater affected by other predictors. 

[Time Series Analysis - Classical Decomposition:]{.underline}\
To better understand the other factors that influence hourly energy demand, we can look at a classical decomposition graphs for our time series data for both yearly and monthly seasonality (Figure 2 and 3).

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}

ggarrange(decom_plot_monthly, decom_plot_annual,
                    ncol = 1, nrow = 2)

```

Looking at the graphs there doesn't appear to be evidence of a long-run trend in hourly energy demand over time period analyzed as the trend seems to be mostly constant when seasonality is defined as 30 days and 365 days. It also appears that seasonality may be important in driving overall variation in electricity demand when seasonality is defined as 365 days since the gray bar is closer in scale to the overall time series graph. Anecdotally , this is intuitive as we can predict that the variance in hourly electricity could be affected by the month. Since month of the year and temperature are it is logical how seasonality based on month affects energy demand given the known relationship on temperature and energy. However, when seasonality is defined as 30 days, the seasonal effect appears to be not as important in the driving overall variation in electricity demand.
