    "text": "Colleen received a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara and held many jobs which helped her navigate the wide range of paths within the environmental field – such as working at a research lab focused on kelp forest ecosystems, at a UC Natural Reserve in the Eastern Sierra Nevada’s, and with hands-on environmental education.\nHowever, it was her fellowship with the UC Carbon Neutrality Initiative that introduced her to the world of clean energy and the impact she can make in the field. After graduating, Colleen followed her interest and joined the community choice energy agency, Silicon Valley Clean Energy. In her role, she managed and developed digital tools to help communities electrify and take advantage of their local, clean electricity.\nCurrently, Colleen is pursuing a Master in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and is excited to unlock data science skills and dive deeper into clean energy questions with a data lens. Colleen aims to build creative data visualizations that connect communities to energy insights and help guide policies, encourage action, and amplify equitable solutions."

    "text": "In February 2021, the state of Texas was in a state of crisis when unusual winter storms left millions without power. Power outages pose an extra threat to customers who those who are medically vulnerable and marginalized groups and historically divested groups may be disproportionately impacted. 1\nThis blog post highlights an initial investigation estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power as a result of the first two storms and exploring if socioeconomic factors are predictors of outage areas.\nThe goal of the investigation was to practice using spatial data and associated functions and packages. Further investigation is needed to answer the questions explored in this practice and this investigation’s limitations are outlined in the conclusion section.\nmethods\nThis section illustrates the code executed to explore our questions.\nHeading to the library\nGet your library card ready because it is time to load these packages.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.10.2, GDAL 3.4.2, PROJ 8.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\nlibrary(stars)\n\nLoading required package: abind\n\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(raster)\n\nLoading required package: sp\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'raster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\nlibrary(terra)\n\nterra 1.6.17\n\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nStep 1: Diving into the Data\nWhat would be a data science project without the data? The following code block uses SQL and the stars package to load in the data needed for the project.\nFor our raster data we used NASA’s Worldview data for February 7, 2021 (before the power outage) and Februray 16, 2021 (during the power outage) to visualize the extent of the power outage in the Houston area. These days were selected as other days during the time frame had too much cloud cover to be useful.\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Data was downloaded and prepped in advance to this assignment.\n\n#reading in the NASA raster files\nnl_feb07_t1<- read_stars('/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif')\n\nnl_feb07_t2 <- read_stars('/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif')\n\nnl_feb16_t1 <-read_stars('/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif')\n\nnl_feb16_t2 <- read_stars('/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif')\n\nNext up we have data from roads. To minimize accounting for light from major highways systems, we used publicly available geographic data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) through Geofabrik’s download sites. This data were downloaded and prepped in advance to contain a subset of highway and raods that intersect with the Houston metropolitan area. We also used data from Geofabrik’s download sites for information on houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n## ---- Highway Data\n# reading in highway data using SQL query\nquery <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\n\n# reading in the highways data with st_read()\nhighways <- st_read(\"/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\", query = query)\n\nReading query `SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'' from data source `/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 6085 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.50429 ymin: 29.00174 xmax: -94.39619 ymax: 30.50886\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n## ---- Houses Data\n# defining the query for the houses\nquery_houses <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL) OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\"\n\n# reading in the highways data with st_read()\nhouses <- st_read(\"/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\", query = query_houses)\n\nReading query `SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL) OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')' from data source `/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 475941 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.50055 ymin: 29.00344 xmax: -94.53285 ymax: 30.50393\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nLastly, we use data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019 from an ArcGIS file geodatabase. The metadata for each layer is available at ACS metadata and this data was downloaded in advance to this investigation.\n\n#reading in geometry data and selecting for the layer containing the geometry\ncensus_geom <- st_read(\"/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\", layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\")\n\nReading layer `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS' from data source \n  `/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb' \n  using driver `OpenFileGDB'\nSimple feature collection with 5265 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -106.6456 ymin: 25.83716 xmax: -93.50804 ymax: 36.5007\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\n\n#reading in income data\nincome_median <- st_read(\"/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\", layer = \"X19_INCOME\")\n\nReading layer `X19_INCOME' from data source \n  `/Users/colleenmccamy/Documents/MEDS/EDS_223_Spatial_Data/data/assignment3/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb' \n  using driver `OpenFileGDB'\n\n\nWarning: no simple feature geometries present: returning a data.frame or tbl_df\n\n\nStep 2: Creating a blackout mask\nThe following code outlines how I created a blackout mask for the Houston area that I could use for identifying impacted homes.\n\n# combing the data into single stars objects for each day\nfeb16_tile <- st_mosaic(nl_feb16_t1, nl_feb16_t2)\nfeb07_tile <- st_mosaic(nl_feb07_t1, nl_feb07_t2)\n\n# adding an indicator of the attributes in the data\nfeb_16_tile_names = setNames(feb16_tile, \"light_16\")\nfeb_07_tile_names = setNames(feb07_tile, \"light_07\")\n\n# matrix alegbra to calculate the difference light difference between the two dates \nblackout_dif <- feb_07_tile_names - feb_16_tile_names\n\n# #filtering for the differences of a drop less that 200 nW cm-2sr-1 as NA\nblackout_mask <- cut(blackout_dif, c(200, Inf), labels = \"outage\")\n\n# vectorizing the blackout mask and fixing any invalid geometries\nblackout_mask_v <- st_as_sf(blackout_mask) |> \n  st_make_valid()\n\n# creating a polygon of Houston's coordinates \nhou_border <- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-96.5,29), c(-96.5,30.5), c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-94.5,29), c(-96.5,29))))\n\n# converting to an sf object and identifying the coordinate reference system\nhou_border_sf <- st_sfc(hou_border, crs = 'EPSG:4326')\n\n# cropping the blackout mask with the Houston polygon\nhou_outage_mask_v <- blackout_mask_v[hou_border_sf, ,]\n\n# reprojectting the cropped object to a new crs and converting it as an sf object\nhou_outage_mask_v_3083 <- st_transform(hou_outage_mask_v, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\noutage_mask_clean <- st_as_sf(hou_outage_mask_v_3083)\n\nStep 3: Excluding highway data\nTo exclude light from highways, we created a buffer of 200 meters and kept areas in our blackout mask that were greater than 200 meters away from a highway.\n\n# selecting the highway geometry data\nhighways_geom <- highways$geom\n\n# transforming the highway geometries to the consistent crs\nhighways_geom <- st_transform(highways_geom, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n# creating a buffer zone for highways geometry data of 200 meters\nhighway_buffer <- st_buffer(x = highways_geom, dist = 200)\nhighway_buffer <- st_transform(highway_buffer, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n# combining the geometries into one and creating a mask that excludes the highway data\nhighway_buffer <- st_union(highway_buffer, by_feature = FALSE)\nmask_hou_highway <- outage_mask_clean[highway_buffer, , op = st_disjoint]\n\nStep 4: Identifying Impacted Homes\nTo find the number of impacted homes, the code below outlines how I used the new blackout mask with the highway data to identify homes most likely impacted by the power outage.\n\n# transforming houses data to be usable\nhouses <- st_transform(houses, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\nhouses_st <- st_as_sf(houses)\n\n# filtering the houses data with the blackout mask\noutage_houses <- houses_st[mask_hou_highway, drop = FALSE]\n\n# identifying how many homes were affected\nprint(paste0(\"There were \", nrow(outage_houses), \" homes affected by the power outage on Feburary 16, 2021.\"))\n\n[1] \"There were 138652 homes affected by the power outage on Feburary 16, 2021.\"\n\n\nStep 4: Investigating Socioeconomic factors\nNow that we have information on the houses that were affected we can match this with the socioeconomic census tract information and determine which census tracts were impacted by the power outage.\n\n# transforming the census data to be consistent with the crs\ncensus_geom <- st_transform(census_geom, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n#selecting the necessary variables and renaming for clarity\nincome_med_select <- income_median |> \n  dplyr::select(\"GEOID\", \"B19013e1\") |> \n  rename(GEOID_Data = GEOID, median_income = B19013e1)\n\n# changing the income object to a data_frame\nincome_med_select_df <- tibble(income_med_select)\n\n# joining census geometries and median income data\ncensus_data <- left_join(census_geom, \n                         income_med_select, \n                         by = \"GEOID_Data\")\n\n# transforming both objects to the correct crs\ncensus_data <- st_transform(census_data, crs = 'EPSG:4326')\noutage_houses <- st_transform(outage_houses, crs = 'EPSG:4326')\n\n# filtering the census data using the outage houses and adding column indicating that these census tracts were part of a blackout\ncensus_outage <- sf::st_filter(census_data, outage_houses) |> \n  mutate(blackout = 'yes')\n\nStep 5: Comparing the incomes of impacted tracts and unimpacted tracts\nIt is time to visualize our findings. This code breaks down the data wrangling needed for the visualizations and the maps and plots created to compare which census tracts experienced a blackout vs the census tracts that did not experience a blackout.\n\n## --- Wrangling our data for our visualizations -----------\n\n# transforming both objects to the crs 4326 to crop it\ncensus_data <- st_transform(census_data, crs = 'EPSG:4326')\nhou_border_sf <- st_transform(hou_border_sf, crs = 'EPSG:4326')\n\n# cropping the census data with the Houston border for filtering\ncensus_data_hou <- census_data[hou_border_sf, ,] \n\n# transforming census data back to the EPSG:3083 crs\ncensus_data_hou <- st_transform(census_data_hou, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n# selecting necessary columns for houston census data\ncensus_data_hou <- census_data_hou |> \n  dplyr::select(\"NAMELSAD\", \"Shape\", \"median_income\", \"GEOID_Data\")\n\n# selecting necessary columns for outage data by census track\ncensus_outage <- census_outage |> \n  dplyr::select(\"blackout\", \"GEOID_Data\")\ncensus_outage_map <- census_outage |> \n  dplyr::select(\"blackout\")\n\n# converting census outage data to a dataframe in order to join\ncensus_outage_df <- as.data.frame(census_outage)\n\n# joining census outage data and census data for all of Houston\ncensus_map_data <- left_join(census_data_hou, \n                             census_outage_df, \n                             by = \"GEOID_Data\")\n\ncensus_map_data <- census_map_data |> \n  dplyr::select('median_income', 'blackout')\n\n# converting census map data to a dataframe to plot\ncensus_plot_data <- data_frame(census_map_data)\n\nWarning: `data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 1.1.0.\nPlease use `tibble()` instead.\n\n# adding an indicator for homes that didn't experience a blackout\ncensus_plot_data <- census_plot_data |> \n  mutate(blackout = replace(blackout, is.na(blackout), \"no\"))\n\n# creating a data frame for homes that experienced a blackout to plot\ncensus_plot_data_blackout <- census_plot_data |> \n  dplyr::select(\"median_income\", \"blackout\") |> \n  filter(blackout == \"yes\")\n\n\n# creating a data frame for homes that didn't experienced a blackout to plot\ncensus_plot_data_no_blackout <- census_plot_data |> \n  dplyr::select(\"median_income\", \"blackout\") |> \n  filter(blackout == \"no\")\n\n\n## ------- Mapping our data ---------------\n\n# changing the view mode to be interactive\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\n# mapping median income by census track and identifying outages by dots\ntm_shape(census_map_data) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"median_income\",\n              palette = c(\"#227c9d\", \n                          \"#17c3b2\", \n                          \"#ffcb77\", \n                          \"#ffe2b3\", \n                          \"#feb3b1\", \n                          \"#fe6d73\"),\n              textNA = \"Missing Income Data\", \n              colorNA = \"#e4ebea\",\n              title = \"Median Income\") +\n  tm_shape(census_outage_map) +\n  tm_dots(shape = 1,\n          title = 'blackout') +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Houston Census Data by Income that Experienced A Power Outage\",\n            legend.outside = TRUE,\n            main.title.size = 1\n            )\n\n\n\n\n\n### ---- Plotting our data --------\n\n# plotting census data that experienced a blackout\nggplot(census_plot_data_blackout, aes(x = median_income)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"#3d5a80\",fill = \"#98c1d9\") +\n  labs(title = \"Median Income for Homes that Experienced a Blackout\",\n       x = \"Median Income\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
